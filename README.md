## Password-Manager
A simple password manager that uses the Fernet module from the [Cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/) library.

We STRONGLY recommend first obfuscating the program then using it, a library like pyarmor will work fine.

## Requirements 
Python >= 3.6
Cryptography Library

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install cryptography
```
Then just run the main.py file in CMD or any Terminal you prefer.

## TO-DO
A Gui.
Multiple Users.
Email OTP.
Recovery keys.
