## Password-Manager
A simple password manager that uses the Fernet module from the [Cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) library.

We STRONGLY recommend first obfuscating the program then using it, a library like pyarmor will work fine.

## Requirements 
Python >= 3.6

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install cryptography
```
Then just run the main.py file in CMD or any linux Terminal you prefer, you will input your PIN and then close the program.
After that, comment from line 5 to 11, then 25 to 31 and uncomment from line 34 to 104 by removing the apostrophes, obfuscate it and you're done.

## TO-DO
A Gui.
